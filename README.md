# Pickup-Futbol

Welcome to Pickup Futbol! Pickup Futbol is a website aimed towards people looking for Pickup Soccer Matches in the Bay Area. I made Pickup Futbol using JavaScript, React and Firebase. Pickup Futbol allows people to create events which people can see under the events tab of the website. When a new event is created a chatroom for that specific event is also created. A user can register or unregister for an event. When clicking the event name, the user will be taken to the chatroom and will also display the list of players names which are registered for the event. To try it out you can use this test account: email: testaccount@test.com password: 123456. Or you can create an account under the login page.
